Here's a list of AI services I'm currently using:

1. ChatGPT.com - currently the standard for AI LLM Chatbots. Also, they have an industry-standard API.
2. Perplexity.ai - a search and lightweight AI LLM Chatbot.
3. Claude.ai - is the closest competitor to ChatGPT for consumer-ready AL LLM Chatbot platform. Unlikely ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai cannot search the internet. Further, the knowledge cutoff of current events and science predated the cutoff of ChatGPT and Gemini.
4. Gemini - Google's version of AI LLM Chatbot. Technologically, it is on the same level as ChatGPT and probably exceeds Claude.ai. However, they tend to be a slow mover compared to the others, likely because of the bureaucracy.

**Honorable mentions**
5. Copilot - this is Microsoft's AI LLM Chatbot. It is based on the ChatGPT model, so it's not unique. However it is tightly and effectively integrated with Microsoft 365 and the Edge browers, and it can be very helpful.
