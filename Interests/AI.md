## AI services I'm currently using

1. [ChatGPT.com](https://www.chatgpt.com) is currently the standard for AI LLM Chatbots and it has an industry-standard API.
2. [Perplexity.ai](https://www.Perplexity.ai) is an AI-driven search engine and lightweight AI LLM Chatbot.
3. [Claude.ai](https://www.Claude.ai) is the closest competitor to ChatGPT for the consumer-ready AI LLM Chatbot platform. Unlike ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai, Claude cannot search the internet. Further, the knowledge cutoff of current events and science predated the cutoff of ChatGPT and Gemini.
4. [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) is Google's version of the AI LLM Chatbot. Technologically, it is on the same level as ChatGPT and probably exceeds Claude.ai. However, they tend to be a slow mover compared to the others, likely because of the bureaucracy.

## Honorable mentions

1. [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) is Microsoft's AI LLM Chatbot. It is based on the ChatGPT model, so it's not unique. However, it is tightly and effectively integrated with Microsoft 365 and the Edge browser, and it can be very helpful.
2. [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new/)

## Coding with AI

Intermediate to advanced computer users can now upskill into intermediate computer coders by using some of the widely available AI LLM Chatbots.

I've been able to tackle some automation projects for my work that I hadn't wanted to tackle the learning curve for. Using ChatGPT and Claude.ai, I created scripts with Python Selenium chrome version and AutoIT. I used AutoIT in a prior job, and it took weeks to automate simple keystrokes. Nowadays, I have been able to create AutoIT scripts that use variables.

A typical workflow involves starting a coding or scripting project on ChatGPT or Claude.ai and hitting a roadblock. Then, copy the project code to the other platform and successfully overcome the issue.
