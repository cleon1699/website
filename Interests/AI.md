**Here's a list of AI services I'm currently using:**

1. ChatGPT.com - currently the standard for AI LLM Chatbots. Also, they have an industry-standard API.
2. Perplexity.ai - a search and lightweight AI LLM Chatbot.
3. Claude.ai - is the closest competitor to ChatGPT for consumer-ready AL LLM Chatbot platform. Unlikely ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai cannot search the internet. Further, the knowledge cutoff of current events and science predated the cutoff of ChatGPT and Gemini.
4. Gemini - Google's version of AI LLM Chatbot. Technologically, it is on the same level as ChatGPT and probably exceeds Claude.ai. However, they tend to be a slow mover compared to the others, likely because of the bureaucracy.

**Honorable mentions:**

5. Copilot - this is Microsoft's AI LLM Chatbot. It is based on the ChatGPT model, so it's not unique. However it is tightly and effectively integrated with Microsoft 365 and the Edge browers, and it can be very helpful.



```
Copy: After selecting one or more items using your mouse or keyboard, press Ctrl + C. This action copies the selected information to the clipboard, allowing you to duplicate it elsewhere without removing it from its original location. Cut: To remove selected items from their current location and place them on the clipboard, press Ctrl + X. This command is useful when you want to relocate text or files instead of just duplicating them. Paste: Once you have copied or cut your desired content, navigate to the location where you want to insert it and press Ctrl + V. This will paste the information from your clipboard into the new location.
