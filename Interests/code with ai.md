Intermediate to advanced computer users can now upskill to intermediate computer coders by using some of the widely available AI LLM Chatbots.

I've been able to tackle some automation projects for my work that I haven't wanted to tackle the learning curve for. By using ChatGPT and Claude.ai, I was able to create scripts with Python Selenium chrome version and AutoIT. I used AutoIT in a prior job and it too weeks to simply automate keystrokes. Now in days, i was able to create AutoIT scripts that used variables.

A common workflow is to start a coding or scripting project on either ChatGPT or Claude.ai and hit a roadblock. Then copying the project code over to the other platform and successfully overcoming the issue.
