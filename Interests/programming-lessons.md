# Understand Programming Languages

Okay, here is a curriculum for an intermediate computer user to understand programming languages, designed for self-paced learning. This curriculum focuses on building a strong conceptual foundation and practical skills. It's structured into modules, each with learning objectives, recommended resources, and suggested projects.

**Target Audience:** Intermediate computer users who are comfortable with using computers, the internet, and basic software, and who have likely done some basic coding (e.g., HTML, CSS, or maybe a little bit of a scripting language).

**Goal:** To develop a solid understanding of how programming languages work, different programming paradigms, and the ability to choose and learn new languages more effectively.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Basic computer literacy.
*   Familiarity with the command line/terminal (basic navigation, file manipulation).
*   High school-level mathematics (algebra, basic logic).
*   A desire to learn and problem-solve.
