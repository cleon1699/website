=== Driving
- Check all of your mirrors when changing lanes. If you move your core, chest, and head closer to the steering wheel or side-to-side while looking at you side mirror, you're able to increase your field of view and eliminate some blind spots.
=== Computers
- Copy/Cut/Paste are you best friends. On windows press and hold these combinations to execute these.
