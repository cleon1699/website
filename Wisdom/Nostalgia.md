## The 1990s and beyond

I grew up in the 1990s and graduated from high school in 2004.

Here is a list of things I remember:

1. Service Merchandise
2. AOL Instant Messenger
3. Pontiac, Saturn, Hummer -- cars that expired
4. Corded phones
5. Cable boxes, DVDs, VHS tapes
6. TV Guide and the TV Guide Channel
