## My Philosophy

I've subscribed to multiple and various philosophies and religions over my lifetime. I was raised Roman Catholic and attended mass service weekly. I also participated in public school religion (PSR) classes in elementary and middle school. I was an alter boy and achieved the status of "head alter boy" during the eight grade.

However my senior year of high school I was exposed to the Protestant church by a girl friend who's family were devoted Lutherans.
