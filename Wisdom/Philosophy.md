## Religion and Philosophy

I've subscribed to multiple and various philosophies and religions over my lifetime. I was raised Roman Catholic and attended mass service weekly. I also participated in public school religion (PSR) elementary and middle school classes. I was an alter boy and achieved the "head alter boy" status during the eighth grade.

However, in my senior year of high school, I was exposed to the Protestant church by a girlfriend whose family were devoted Lutherans. During the 1st year of my post-high school life, I "converted" to LCMS Lutheranism but completed multi-week classes before Sunday service. I also studied various aspects of Christianity independently through online blogs and websites, books, radio, and other resources. However, the community aspects of the church were a bit more uncomfortable for me, and I eventually stopped participating in services.

In my second year of college, I took an Intro to Western Philosophy course for general studies credit. It was a large class in one of those big lecture halls with stadium-style seating. I enjoyed the class. I was always a bit of a daydreamer philosopher, and it gave me a broad overview of the history of philosophical thought and recent contemporary ideas.

Over the next five or so years, my philosophy regarding life evolved into an agnostic worldview in which we can't know the meaning of life and existence due to human physical and biological limitations. Agnosticism has also become my theological philosophy.

Today, I generally identify as a Catholic and see my experience with the Lutheran church as more of an exploratory period in my life, where the primary reason was to impress and win back a girlfriend. However, I believe that all religions are human constructs that attempt to give meaning to what little we understand about ourselves and our universe.
