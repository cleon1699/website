+++ Driving
- Check all of your mirrors when changing lanes. If you move your core, chest, and head closer to the steering wheel or side-to-side while looking at you side mirror, you're able to increase your field of view and eliminate some blind spots.
+++ Computers
- Copy/Cut/Paste are your best friends. On Windows, press and hold these combinations to execute these commands:
'Copy: After selecting one or more items using your mouse or keyboard, press Ctrl + C. This action copies the selected information to the clipboard, allowing you to duplicate it elsewhere without removing it from its original location14.
Cut: To remove selected items from their current location and place them on the clipboard, press Ctrl + X. This command is useful when you want to relocate text or files instead of just duplicating them.
Paste: Once you have copied or cut your desired content, navigate to the location where you want to insert it and press Ctrl + V. This will paste the information from your clipboard into the new location.'
