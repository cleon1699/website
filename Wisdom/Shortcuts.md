## Driving

### Mirrors

Check all of your mirrors when changing lanes. If you move your core, chest, and head closer to the steering wheel or side-to-side while looking at your side mirror, you're able to increase your field of view and eliminate some blind spots.

### Stick Shift

Just avoid it completely. You are a normal driver if you don't know how and it's a esoteric skill that isn't relavent anymore.

## Computers

### Cut.Copy.Paste

- **Copy (Ctrl + C):** After selecting one or more items using your mouse or keyboard, press Ctrl + C. This action copies the selected information to the clipboard, allowing you to duplicate it elsewhere without removing it from its original location.

- **Cut (Ctrl + X):** To remove selected items from their current location and place them on the clipboard, press Ctrl + X. This command is useful when you want to relocate text or files instead of just duplicating them. 

- **Paste (Ctrl + V):** Once you have copied or cut your desired content, navigate to the location where you want to insert it and press Ctrl + V. This will paste the information from your clipboard into the new location.
