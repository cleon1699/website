# Musings, random information, and lessons learned

## This Website's Purpose

I feel fortunate to have lived through both the analog and digital ages. I remember using MS-DOS, playing Oregon Trail, experiencing dial-up internet, and having a flip phone. I was a freshman in high school when the "dot-com" bubble burst.

My early experiences included a mix of hobbyist interests and general curiosity about computers and networking. Without powerful search engines and vast amounts of online content, I learned about hardware and software the hard way—through trial and error.

My first experience with technology training in a classroom setting was a one-day course at the local community college called "Computers for Kids." The learning plan involved pairing students up to disassemble a working desktop PC in the morning and then reassemble it after lunch. If everything worked at the end of the day, the class was considered a success.

It’s remarkable to witness how far we’ve come, and I understand how different these experiences can be for many of us.

My hope for this webpage is to create a space where I can capture some of my knowledge and share it with others. This may help people avoid the mistakes I've made while allowing them to learn the lessons those experiences taught me.
