# Musings, random information, and life hacks

## This Website's Purpose

I'm forunate to be of an age that I grew up in both the analog and the digital ages. I was a freshman in high school when the "dot-com" bubble burst. I remember MSDOS, Oregon Trail, dial-up internet, and flip phones.

As part of my early life experince, I had a mix of hobby and general interest in computers and networking. Without powerful search engines and oceans of online content at my disposable, I learned about hardware and software the hard way... through trial and error. 

My first experience with any classroom technology training was a one day course at the local community college. "Computers for kids" was what it was called. The learning plan was to pair up students and have them disassemble a working desktop PC in the morning, and then put the tower back together after lunch. If everything worked at the end, the class was a success.
